_Hani_ is an iceball planet in the [Pamnaya Prekta](https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/UdWhNiPN5UQmCmT9ahT3/system/6qbnzezh9S7axStxcExi) system (0304). Despite the lack of usable atmosphere, _Hani_ sports one of the largest [Human](Humans) populations in the sector. The underground geology is freakish; a planet-wide network of tunnels and immense caverns contains just the right amount of mineral deposits and liquid water for Terran life. Settlers found the subterranean environment far easier to terraform that any planetary surface, and the active core provided almost limitless geothermal energy.

After the Scream, _Hani_ society was unable to maintain anything more than rudimentary technology. The vast network of PreTech grow-lights stay on, and the masses exist mostly on subsistence farming.
