# Anrbzyv-udaz-gavr #

The *Anrbzyv-udaz-gavr* (literally "This Is Us") are a species of small gray carbon-based humanoids. Humans have only recently encountered their deep-space scouting parties. Xenophobic and violent, they have already earned a list of derogatory nicknames, most commonly *Skinnies* or *Elgyems* ("LGMs" or Little Green Men).

## Technology

Elgyems appear to have capabilities in the TL4-TL5 range. Their starships appear to employ oversized [Alcubierra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive) ring-drives, giving them a tremendous acceleration advantage in realspace.

## Meta

Here is a translator for [Tolkien-Blackspeech to English](http://physics.muni.cz/~dugi/index.fcgi/black), which can be used to generate Elgyem dialect.
