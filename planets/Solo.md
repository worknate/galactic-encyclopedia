## Solo

**Solo** is lone planet in the Nima system (0605). The climate and biosphere have been gently altered by the [Factor](../species/Factors) to make them quite pleasant for [humans](../species/Humans); the main city rests within a habitable zone best described as "comfortably Mediterranean".

This planet is a critical asset to the Factor. The system serves as a trade hub for the sector and remains their most active economic and diplomatic interaction with humans. Solo itself has a large variety of raw materials that may otherwise be difficult or expensive to maintain, and the diverse geography and ecology provides the Factor with a wealth of research opportunities outside of their normal asteroid-and-gas-giant habitat.

### Firma

**Firma** was designed as a trade hub and remains their most active economic and diplomatic interaction with humans. Nestled on top of a rising ocean-side peninsula, the city is small but beautiful, with ideal weather. Several thousand humans claim permanent residence here, providing visiting merchants, scientists, and adventurers with the necessary shops, restaurants and entertainment they may need. There are a number of schools and a state-of-the-art hospital. The small spaceport sits alongside the large central marketplace, where hundreds of vendor stalls and trade houses help drive commerce between various human interests and their Factor hosts.

### Floating Cities

The Factor colony consists of a number of floating organism-cities, like immense hydrogen-filled jellyfish. There is one terrestrial city named Firma, which houses several thousand human merchants, scientists, and adventurers. The mobile city-creatures give them the ability to reposition their activities as localized weather, seasonal changes, or natural resources demand.


### Saheki Fuel Station

The refueling station is the only place to get starship fuel in the system.
