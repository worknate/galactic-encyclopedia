# Andophala

*Andophala* (n√©e Al-Sham XXII) is the sole Terran-sized planet in the Al-Sham system. Andophala is a rare example of a planet colonized simultaneously by multiple political entities. There are three nation-colonies; Dnepr, Arslan Tash, and Mnarani. The planet is very Earth-like, with a large number of small- and medium-sized continents divided by numerous interconnected oceans. Natural resources are abundant, and the native biosphere is advanced and diverse.

## Dnepr

**Kosmotras** is the capital of **Dnepr**, a mountainous island-nation situated in the tropics of Andophala. Dnepr is not a large nation, but controls roughly a third of the surface of Andophala as part of the original colonization treaty. Most of this surface is covered by ocean.

Dnepr is densely populated, with most citizens being of Western European and Slavic ancestry. English is the official state language and there are some Russian-speaking communities. The overall tech level is TL4.

The Dneprian surface navy and space forces are modern and well-equipped, but consists mostly of draftees, the exception being their marines, who are well regarded even in neighboring star systems. Dneprian space forces are limited primarily to a handful of system ships.

Kosmotras is known as a wealthy tech hub, with a focus on cybernetic enhancements, although in recent years the economy has begun to backslide, in part due to government mismanagement, compounded by rampant corruption. This destabilization has resulted in large-scale protests, sometimes turning violent. The powerful casino industry, once highly-regarded throughout the sector, has fallen the hardest, with crumbling facilities, rampant organized crime, and zero oversight by the authorities.

## Arslan Tash

**Ras Mishab** is the capital of **Arslan Tash**, a large nation of fertile plains in the northern hemisphere of Adophala. The eastern border is a wilderness frontier lined with small mountains, marking both the political boundary and the transition from grasslands to the sub-tropical temperate forests of northern Dnepr.

Arslan Tash is the bread-basket of Adophala, and exports several valuable, exotic fruits and vegetables to other systems in the sector. The government subsidizes well-regarded research universities, with a focus on biologics, agriculture, and the arts.

A theocracy, Arslan Tash is ruled by Caliph, selected by the clergy, nominally bound by a "divine" constitution strongly influenced by a post-Scream flavor of Islamic law. The nation has found some measure of success economically despite repression of women and religious and sexual freedoms.

Arslan Tash has a well-equipped aerospace force, with a ground force that is better suited to security and logistics. In their recent war with Dnepr, they have managed to gain completely atmosphere-superiority, effectively creating a blockade. The third planetary nation, Mnarani, remains officially neutral in the conflict, but also suffers under this umbrella.
