## Andophala

**Andophala** (n√©e Al-Sham XXII) is the sole Terran-sized planet in the Al-Sham system. Andophala is a rare example of a planet colonized simultaneously by multiple political entities. There are three nation-colonies; Dnepr, Arslan Tash, and Mnarani. The planet is very Earth-like, with a large number of small- and medium-sized continents divided by numerous interconnected oceans. Natural resources are abundant, and the native biosphere is advanced and diverse.

### Dnepr

**Kosmotras** is the capital of **Dnepr**, a mountainous island-nation situated in the tropics of Andophala. Dnepr is not a large nation, but controls roughly a third of the surface of Andophala as part of the original colonization treaty. Most of this surface is covered by ocean.

Dnepr is densely populated, with most citizens being of Western European and Slavic ancestry. English is the official state language and there are some Russian-speaking communities. The overall tech level is TL4.

The Dneprian surface navy and space forces are modern and well-equipped, but consists mostly of  draftees, the exception being their marines, who are well regarded even in neighboring star systems. Dneprian space forces are limited primarily to system ships.

Kosmotras is known as a wealthy tech hub, with a focus on cybernetic enhancements, although in recent years the economy has begun to backslide, in part due to government mismanagement, compounded by rampant corruption. This destabilization has resulted in large-scale protests, sometimes turning violent. The powerful casino industry, once highly-regarded throughout the sector, has fallen the hardest, with crumbling facilities, rampant organized crime, and zero oversight by the authorities.
