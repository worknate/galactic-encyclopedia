Most of the population is centered on the large southern continent *Khurasia*. A number of small shipyards are in operation.

## Psionic Academies

Aganian is one of the few planets that have managed to redevelop the basics of psychic training. Without this education, a potential psychic is doomed to either madness or death unless they refrain from using their abilities. Psionic academies are rare enough that offworlders are often sent there to study by wealthy patrons. The secrets of psychic mentorship, the protocols and techniques that allow a psychic to successfully train another, are carefully guarded at these academies. Most are closely affiliated with the planetary government.

## Events of February 20, 3200

Aganian was surprised by an [Elgyem](../species/Anrbzyv-udaz-gavr) carrier strike force around 22:00 KMT. Most active patrol craft were disabled or destroyed. The primary orbital station _Boris_ was lost with all hands. Every major starport was bombarded from orbit, and any communication center larger than Class IV was either attacked by strike fighters or seized by marines. Anti-ship batteries and ground forces fought valiantly, but the deep space station _Bole 4_ lost all communications the next day.
