## Atquuslaed

Atquuslaed is a planet in the Berd system (0302). The climate is mild and temperate, the atmosphere is mostly human-breathable, but there is no native biosphere. The terrain can be best described as desert, with continents of sand and mountains that reach into the stratosphere. The surface has some water and receives periodic rainfall. Visitors are encouraged to wear special respirators; these will filter dust particulates and noxious gasses along with the blooms of micro-organisms imported by human activity.

### Government

Atquuslaed was originally colonized by human settlers of Nordic ancestry, and the planetary government is nominally a representative democracy. The corporate interests of Nakajima Heavy Industries hold much sway in all political activity.

### Locations

The multi-domed city of Nerima boasts a population of 11 million inhabitants. The planet's lone starport lies adjacent to a major shipyard and several large strip-mines are within a few miles of the city's edge.

### Industry

Nakajima Heavy Industries operates their largest facilities here, including best-in-system shipyards, several mines, and orbital mining facilities around the two large gas giants. The Nerima shipyard has pre-tech origins, and is capable of "dry-docking" capital-class hulls, building or overhauling large starships planet-side much cheaper--and faster--than anywhere else in the sector.

Atquaaslaed has a relatively large cache of rare-earth elements, and the  leveraged a number of tactics to become the sector's only supplier for a number of materials that are important or critical for TL4 technology.
