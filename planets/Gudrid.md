## Gudrid

Gudrid is an outpost planet in the Tolantz Urietal system (0103). The atmosphere is mild in temperate but caustic; the only human presence consists of a domed mining colony. The meager profits from raw metal ores combined with charity from nearby sectors keeps the population alive.

The situation is even worse on the mining operations on the gas giants in the system; cramped quarters, extreme temperatures, leaky radiation shiedling and periodic gravity flunctuations compound the suffering of the miners and their families.

### Technology

Other than some TL3 heavy machinery and small arms, most citizens in the system exist at an impoverished level, with access to little more than TL1 technology.

### Government

Gudrid has no government per se; the mines are operated by the Delta Consolidated Mining company, which provides official representation in the sector, along with the minimal (poorly-trained, poorly-equipped) local security forces. The company operates a number of interstellar transports, two system patrol boats, and personel armed with a mix of TL3 and TL4 technology.
