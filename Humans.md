# Humans #

*Humans* are the most populous species in the sector. Carbon-based, omnivorous, medium-sized bipeds evolved from terrestrial mammals. Species displays mild sexual dimorphism. Mostly hairless. Comfortable under stars within a moderate spectrum of [G2V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification) and planets well within [median Terran norms](Planets). The percentage of their population with psionic powers is relatively small. The species is marked by strong individualism and wide cultural diversity.

## Technology

Humans once achieved TL5, however their entire society was thrown into chaos during the events following the Scream. Within the last century (Terran standard) the most prosperous settlements have recovered as far as TL4, the Silence has lifted, and interstellar commerce has resumed.

## Language

Humans have tenaciously held onto [the most popular Earth languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers). The most commonly encountered are English and Mandarin, followed by Spanish, French, Arabic, and Russian.
