# House Rules #

## Character Creation

* Maximum Hit Points at first level. 

## Combat

* To ***Grab*** an opponent, an attacker must make a successful _Unarmed attack_, and then win an opposed Punch or Exert skill check, as per _Forcing Enemy Movement_. Damage is only rolled after winning the opposed skill check. The enemy is now restrained and must make a successful save vs. Evasion as a Main Action to break free. On subsequent rounds, the attacker may deal _Unarmed attack_ damage to the restrained target automatically.
* ***Called Shots*** can be made during combat by rolling an attack roll with an additional -4 penalty. All other modifiers still apply, including normal Armor Class and cover modifiers. At the GM's discretion, damage from a _Called Shot_ may be treated as an _Execution Attack_, dealing maximum damage and the victim must save vs. Physical minus the attacker's skill level or they are mortally wounded.
* During an attack roll, in place of a single -4 penalty, a player can substitute a ***Disadvantage***. The attack is rolled twice, simultaneously, using the lower of the two results. Only player characters can make such rolls. _Disadvantages_ provide a bit of cinematic flair; [the math](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/14690/how-does-rolling-two-dice-and-taking-the-higher-affect-the-average-outcome?newreg=323b7e7d4b524d85af67731999bce478) gives a similar penalty while still offering a small chance of success.
* Ship-class weapons deal *quadrupal* damage against vehicles and power armor.
* Starships and Vehicles that are stationary in relation to their attacker have AC 10
* Starships and Vehicles that are stationary in relation to their attacker and are within 10 meters are hit automatically
* Vehicles in motion use their normal AC plus their Speed
* Starships use their normal AC against all targets

## Gravity

* Additional gravity rules adapted from [d20 Future](http://dmreference.com/MRD/Future/Environments/Gravity.htm) within SWN guidelines.

### Zero or Low Gravity

* Speed: A creature's movement is double their normal rate for all modes of movement.
* Carrying Capacity: A creature's normal carrying capacity is doubled.
* Skill Checks: Creatures gain a +2 bonus on Strength-based skill checks but suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls and Evasion saving throws, unless they are native to low- or zero-gravity.
* Falling Damage: Falling damage is reduced to 1d4-1 points per 3 meters fallen. Creatures in a zero-gravity environment do not take fall damage.

### High Gravity 

* Speed: A creature's movement is half their normal rate for all modes of movement.
* Carrying Capacity: A creature's normal carrying capacity is halved.
* Skill Checks: Creatures take a -2 penalty on Strength-based skill checks, attack rolls, and Evasion saving throws, unless they are native to high gravity.
* Falling Damage: Falling damage is increased to 1d8+1 points per 3 meters fallen.
